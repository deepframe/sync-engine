Title: Namespaces

Namespaces are essentially references to linked accounts. They are the top-level unit of a user's data. For example, a user who has one Exchange account and two Gmail accounts linked to Nilas will have three distinct namespaces.

The `/n` endpoint returns the list of namespaces you can access with the access token you provide. Generally, `GET /n` should be the first request you make after authenticating a new user. Typically, access tokens provide access to a single namespace, but this may change in the future.

```


# Getting a Single Namespace

```
:::xml
GET https://api.nilas.com/n/<namespace_id>
```
