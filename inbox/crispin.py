class CrispinClient(object):
    """
    Generic IMAP client wrapper.

    One thing to note about crispin clients is that *all* calls operate on
    the currently selected folder.

    Crispin will NEVER implicitly select a folder for you.

    This is very important! IMAP only guarantees that folder message UIDs
    are valid for a "session", which is defined as from the time you
    SELECT a folder until the connection is closed or another folder is
    selected.

    Crispin clients *always* return long ints rather than strings for number
    data types, such as message UIDs, Google message IDs, and Google thread
    IDs.

    All inputs are coerced to strings before being passed off to the IMAPClient
    connection.

    You should really be interfacing with this class via a connection pool,
    see `connection_pool()`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    account_id : int
        Database id of the associated IMAPAccount.
