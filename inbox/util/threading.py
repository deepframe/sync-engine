# A simple tree-based threading algorithm. It takes as input a list of messages
# and builds a reference tree using only the message-id, in-reply-to references
# and received-date headers.
#
# Here's the algo stages:
#
# 1. Sort the messages list by received_date. This is to make sure that we
#    insert the messages in the tree in the right order, because the algo
#    does not tolerate weird input (i.e: a parent message received after
#    one of its replies -- thankfully this does not happen often in the real
#    world. If it does get an email server that does not go down
#    every other day).
#
# 2. Insert the messages in a tree, starting from the first. The algo tries
#    to "house" a child next to its direct parent, as specified in its
#    in-reply-to/references. If it's unable to find the parent, it will
#    look for the closest reference. If there's no reference found,
#    it will try to find the closest message by reception date.
#
# 3. Traverse the tree in level-order. Why level-order? Because in this case
#           A
#          / \
#         B   C
#        /
#       D
#    it makes more sense to have the thread be A-B-C-D than A-B-D-C
