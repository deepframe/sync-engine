class DeleteHandler(gevent.Greenlet):
    """
    We don't outright delete message objects when all their associated
    uids are deleted. Instead, we mark them by setting a deleted_at
    timestamp. This is so that we can identify when a message is moved between
    folders, or when a draft is updated.

    This class is responsible for periodically checking for marked messages,
    and deleting them for good if they've been marked as deleted for longer
    than message_ttl seconds.

    Parameters
    ----------
    account_id, namespace_id: int
        IDs for the namespace to check.
    uid_accessor: function
        Function that takes a message and returns a list of associated uid
        objects. For IMAP sync, this would just be
        `uid_accessor=lambda m: m.imapuids`
    message_ttl: int
        Number of seconds to wait after a message is marked for deletion before

        deleting it for good.
