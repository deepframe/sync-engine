IMAP SYNC ENGINE
----------------

Okay, here's the deal.

The IMAP sync engine runs per-folder on each account. This allows behaviour
like the Inbox to receive new mail via polling while we're still running the
initial sync on a huge All Mail folder.

Only one initial sync can be running per-account at a time, to avoid
hammering the IMAP backend too hard (Gmail shards per-user, so parallelizing
folder download won't actually increase our throughput anyway).

Any time we reconnect, we have to make sure the folder's uidvalidity hasn't
changed, and if it has, we need to update the UIDs for any messages we've
already downloaded. A folder's uidvalidity cannot change during a session
(SELECT during an IMAP session starts a session on a folder) (see
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501#section-2.3.1.1).

Note that despite a session giving you a HIGHESTMODSEQ at the start of a
SELECT, that session will still always give you the latest message list
including adds, deletes, and flag changes that have happened since that
highestmodseq. (In Gmail, there is a small delay between changes happening on
the web client and those changes registering on a connected IMAP session,
though bizarrely the HIGHESTMODSEQ is updated immediately.) So we have to keep
in mind that the data may be changing behind our backs as we're syncing.
Fetching info about UIDs that no longer exist is not an error but gives us
empty data.

Folder sync state is stored in the ImapFolderSyncStatus table to allow for
restarts.

Here's the state machine:


        -----
        |   ----------------         ----------------------
        ∨   | initial sync | <-----> | initial uidinvalid |
----------  ----------------         ----------------------
| finish |      |    ^
----------      |    |_________________________
        ^       ∨                              |
        |   ----------------         ----------------------
        |---|      poll    | <-----> |   poll uidinvalid  |
            ----------------         ----------------------
            |  ∧
            ----

We encapsulate sync engine instances in greenlets for cooperative coroutine
scheduling around network I/O.

--------------
SESSION SCOPES
--------------

Database sessions are held for as short a duration as possible---just to
query for needed information or update the local state. Long-held database
sessions reduce scalability.
