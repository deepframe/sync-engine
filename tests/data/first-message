Those of you not running MIME-compliant mail readers won't get a lot out
of this, nor will those without ftp access to the Internet, but for the
lucky few....

Here are the infamous Telephone Chords, the world's premier (=only)
all-Bellcore barbershop quartet, singing about MIME.  Note that because
the "message/external-body" MIME construct is used, this whole message
is only about 3000 bytes -- at least, until you start reading it.  :-)
